  → ResNet50 is more robust

Crop Variations
  ResNet50: 80.0% (drop: +0.0%)
  ViT-B/16: 68.0% (drop: -8.0%)
  → ResNet50 is more robust

Context Removal
  ResNet50: 70.0% (drop: +10.0%)
  ViT-B/16: 60.0% (drop: +0.0%)
  → ViT-B/16 is more robust

Watermark
  ResNet50: 80.0% (drop: +0.0%)
  ViT-B/16: 60.0% (drop: +0.0%)

Texture/Color Bias
  ResNet50: 80.0% (drop: +0.0%)
  ViT-B/16: 60.0% (drop: +0.0%)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. ResNet50 shows 1 significant biases
2. ViT-B/16 shows 2 significant biases

3. ResNet50 achieves higher baseline accuracy

4. Architecture differences:
   - CNNs (ResNet) have stronger inductive biases
   - Transformers (ViT) learn from data more flexibly
   - Both show some reliance on context/background
